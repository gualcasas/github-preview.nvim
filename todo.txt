[x] implement auto scroll & make it configurable
[x] send buffer content on init, page opens with no content otherwise
[x] if user starts server after server had been started somewhere else kill other server and restart in current session
  [] if server belongs to current session, update buffer id
[] send message when we want to close browser tab instead of closing onclose, if we close tab on ws.onclose, we can't refresh
