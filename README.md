## Demo

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallpants/gifs/main/github-preview.nvim/demo.gif)

## Requirements

1. [Bun](https://bun.sh)
2. [Neovim](https://neovim.io)

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    'wallpants/github-preview.nvim',
    opts = {}
    -- optionally, add a keymap
    keys = {
        { "<leader>mp", "<cmd>GithubPreviewToggle<cr>" }
    },
}
```

## Customization

```lua
require('github-preview').setup({
    -- these are the default values, any values
    -- you specify will be merged with this dictionary

    port = 6041,

    cursor_line = {
        disable = false,

        -- CSS color
        -- if you provide an invalid value, cursorline will be invisible
        color = "rgb(200 100 20 / 0.2)",
    },

    scroll = {
        disable = false,

        -- Between 0 and 100.
        -- Play around with this number until you find the offset you like.
        -- VERY LOW and VERY HIGH numbers might be out of screen
        top_offset_pct = 35,
    },
})
```

## Usage

üö® The first time you run `:GithubPreviewStart`, it might take a few seconds for your browser to open as dependencies are being downloaded.
This might happen again after a plugin update if there were any changes to the plugin dependencies.

### `:GithubPreviewStart`

Start service. If an instance of `github-preview.nvim` is already running,
be it by the current Neovim instance or another, the older `github-preview.nvim`
is unalived in favour of the younger one.

### `:GithubPreviewStop`

Stops the service. Closes browser tab as well.

### `:GithubPreviewToggle`

Starts the service if not running or stops it if it's already running.
